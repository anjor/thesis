\chapter{White noise forcing in \Gand}
\label{gandalf:app:forcing}

In this appendix, we illustrate how a white-noise source term is implemented in \Gand.
Consider a field $\theta$ driven by a delta-correlated source $\chi$,
\bea
    \pd{\theta}{t} + \ldots = \chi,\\
    \langle\chi(t)\chi(t')\rangle = \epsilon \delta(t-t'),
\eea
where $\epsilon$ is the power at which $\chi$ injects energy into $\theta$.
